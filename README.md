# Tutorial on Deep Generative Models in Tensorflow

This repository consists of a series of TensorFlow tutorials that I'm writing as I'm teaching myself about deep generative models. Each lesson consists of a tutorial that primarily focuses on teaching core concepts, and then an extension that consists of a fun experiment that came to my mind as I was writing the tutorial.

1. [Why Generative Models](https://github.com/abidlabs/Deep-Generative-Models-Tutorial/blob/master/1.%20Why%20Generative%20Models.ipynb)? (*Extension*: [Linear Interpolation Between Images](https://github.com/abidlabs/Deep-Generative-Models-Tutorial/blob/master/1X.%20Linear%20Interpolation%20with%20Images.ipynb))
1. [The Simplest Generative Models](https://github.com/abidlabs/Deep-Generative-Models-Tutorial/blob/master/2.%20The%20Simplest%20Generative%20Models%20(Independent%20Features).ipynb)

Would very much love suggestions or feedback! Feel free to create an issue or ping me at a12d [at] stanford [dot] edu.
