    "This notebook is designed to provide motivation and intuition for why generative models exist, by showing how they relate to discriminative models (regressors, classifiers) that you may already be familiar with. We also explore why probabilistic models are a natural way to think about generation, we review standard methods to build generative models, and we end by talking about real-world applications of generative models."

    "In the way humans think, **discrimination** -- the ability to categorize and classify objects -- is usually very tightly linked to the ability to **generate** -- the ability to imagine or generate new kinds of objects. When you teach a child the digits 0 through 9, they are not only able to tell the different digits apart, but also conjure up images of the digits in their head when told to \"think of the digit 7.\" "

    "However, on a purely algorithmic level, a machine that is able to discriminate successfully does not necessarily mean that it can also generate well. Consider a simple example of a machine that is designed to discriminate between the handwritten images of the digits $0$ and $1$. An algorithm may do quite well on this task simply by looking at whether the center pixel of the image is included in the handwritten stroke -- if it is, the algorithm predicts $1$; otherwise, it predicts $0$. Such a simple algorithm, as shown below, is quite accurate at discrimination: it gets $99\\%$ accuracy discriminating between these two digits on the MNIST dataset. However, it hardly knows enough to generate new images of $0$ and $1$!"

    "* **Learning:** classical statistics provides many methods (e.g. maximum likelihood estimation) to \"learn\" an optimal probability distribution from a family of probability distributions, given samples of the distribution. This methods can be leveraged to learn the appropriate generative model for a dataset.\n",
    "* **Conditioning:** it is well-understood how to adapt (\"condition\") probability distributions based on prior information. These methods can be used to adapt probability distribution when some properties are known about the sample that is intended to be generated (e.g. its label, or the top half of the image).\n",
    "* **Inference:** inference refers to estimating parts of the probability distribution, given other parts or given a particular samples. It allows us to ask questions of the probability distribution, which is often useful with generative models.\n",

    "Additionally, some generative models to provide a **likelihood** for a given sample. In other words, it is possible to evaluate $p_X(\\cdot)$ for a given sample. This can be useful (e.g. for anomaly detection) to determine whether a candidate sample could really have come from the training dataset or not. In other probabilistic methods, $p_X(\\cdot)$ is indirectly defined, so it is not possible to compute likelihoods."

    "\"But how is this used in real life?\" If you're wondering that, here are just a few ways generative models are used by researchers and in industry. You'll see a lot more applications in the later notebooks!\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Speech synthesis**: synthesizing realistic speech from text is an important problem that is usually tackled through complex generative models.\n",
    "* **Anomaly detection**: a method that determines the likelihood of samples can be used to detect anomalies in all kinds of data\n",
    "* **Domain translation**: translating between different kinds of images (from photos to paintings, or MRIs to CT scans) has been achieved quite successfully with generative models.\n",
    "* **Interpolation**: being able to interpolate between images while producing a sequence of realistic images is useful for understanding/teaching the effect of changing underlying variations. This is a harder problem that it may look. We show in part(b) of this notebook how poorly direct linear interpolation of samples performs!"
